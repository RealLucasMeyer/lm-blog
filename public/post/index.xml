      <description>Reflecting on FY18 and planning for FY19 I have worked at Microsoft for long enough that it&amp;rsquo;s easier for me to make plans in tandem with the Microsoft fiscal calendar. It runs from July to June, so we&amp;rsquo;re very close to the end of FY18 and starting FY19.
FY18 Recap Looking back, FY18 was a year of recovery, as was FY17. We&amp;rsquo;ve had our share of health-related scares at my home, and we&amp;rsquo;re still working through some of those.</description>

      <description>Recently, as part of a computer refresh, I have moved from a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to a Lenovo P51. The Microsoft Surface Pro 3 was the right computer for me at the time I got it, but as time went by my position changed substantially, and it ceased to be appropriate for me.
When I got the Surface, the core of my work consisted in traveling, having conference calls and light emailing and spreadsheet work.</description>

      <description>From &amp;ldquo;For a future to be possible&amp;rdquo;, by Thich Nhat Hanh:
 In Buddhism, there are three kinds of gifts. The first is the gift of material resources. The second is to help people rely on themselves, to offer them the technology and know-how to stand on their own feet. (&amp;hellip;)
The third is the gift of non-fear. We are afraid of many things. We feel insecure, afraid of being alone, afraid of sickness and dying.</description>

      <description>Florida has nice weather most of the time, but also has extreme weather occasionally.
Hurricane Irma happened when I was out on a business trip, and my family was in Parkland, FL. Forecasts went from &amp;ldquo;maybe it will hit you&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;if you stay you&amp;rsquo;ll surely die&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s not going to hit you anymore&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Phew, it will miss&amp;rdquo; in four days.
We did a lot of preparation using conditional probabilities.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on 2018-02-26, after thinking a lot about guns after the Parkland School Shooting, but I&amp;rsquo;m burying this article in the past because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of passion around this topic.
 I live in Parkland, FL, and I have three kids. When the Parkland School Shooting happened, my kids were in elementary school, and out of danger. Many of our friends and their kids were not so lucky as we were.</description>
