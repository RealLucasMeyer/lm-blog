      <title>Lenovo P51 - the Data Scientist&#39;s laptop</title>
      <link>/post/lenovo-p51-the-data-scientist-laptop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, as part of a computer refresh, I have moved from a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to a Lenovo P51.
The Microsoft Surface Pro 3 was the right computer for me at the time I
got it, but as time went by my position changed substantially, and it ceased to be appropriate for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got the Surface, the core of my work consisted in traveling, having conference calls and
light emailing and spreadsheet work. As time went by, my work went back to creating analytics,
creating presentations about analytics, and traveling. There is where the screen of the Surface
becomes a liability at 12 inches. I wanted something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And boy, is the P51 bigger. It has a 15-inch screen and a power brick that alone is twice as heavy
as the Surface Pro. It&amp;rsquo;s big enough to have a keyboard that comes with a numeric keypad. Since I still
have to travel a lot, I chose the P51 over the beefier 17-inch P71. The P71 won&amp;rsquo;t even fit in my
somewhat large Osprey backpack. The P51 barely fits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to some standardization constraints, my P51 is the 1920x1080 version with touch screen. It has
32 Gb of RAM and a 500 Gb SSD. It has the i7 7820HQ running at 2.9 GHz and a Quadro M2200 GPU. If I
had the option, I&amp;rsquo;d choose the 4K screen and the Xeon processor, but I did not have that option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battery life is surprisingly good. For the kind of things that I do in planes (writing blog posts,
editing presentations, light programming), the battery seems to last well over 8h without Wi-Fi and about 7h
with Wi-Fi. I have yet to run out of battery in a flight. I have read that the earlier version
of the P51, the P50, would trip the circuit breaker of a plane if you tried to plug it in. I have not
attempted to plug in the P51 yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The P51 is usable in the Premium Economy seats and, of course, in business and first class seats,
but I have the impression that it would not fit well in the economy class of carriers that have
a very small distance between seats (like American Airlines domestic flights), especially if the
person in front of you reclines their seat. It works well in exit seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One gripe I had about the Surface Pro 3 was that I always had to travel with a USB hub, a mouse, and
a couple mini-DisplayPort adapters. The P51 comes with a mechanical keyboard, the beloved TrackPoint,
a good TouchPad, 4 USB ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port, and, to my surprise,
a mini-DisplayPort, so I get to keep all the adapters I had for the Surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also considered the P51-S. The slimmer version trades off some power (it goes from quad-core to
dual-core) for a thinner, lighter frame. I think the P51-S would also have been a solid choice, but I
think it would force me to do most of my work from a workstation and/or a server that I&amp;rsquo;d need to
remote into frequently, adding to the stress of versioning and synchronizing. Somewhat
counter-intuitively, I chose the heavier computer &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I travel a lot, as it has enough power
for me to do the vast majority of my work on it and use a server or workstation just for the real
hardcore stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the Lenovo P51 is a great computer for the traveling data scientist. It&amp;rsquo;s powerful enough
to be used as your primary machine. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s near the top limit of a computer that is comfortable
to travel with, but still &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; that limit. I got used to it in no time and completely gave up my
desktop workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The three types of gifts in Buddhism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &amp;ldquo;For a future to be possible&amp;rdquo;, by Thich Nhat Hanh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Buddhism, there are three kinds of gifts. The first is the gift of material resources. The second is to help people rely on themselves, to offer them the technology and know-how to stand on their own feet. (&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is the gift of non-fear. We are afraid of many things. We feel insecure, afraid of being alone, afraid of sickness and dying. To help people not be destroyed by their fears, we practice the third kind of gift-giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Hurricane Irma</title>
      <link>/post/hurricane-irma/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Florida has nice weather most of the time, but also has extreme weather occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Irma happened when I was out on a business trip, and my family was in Parkland, FL.
Forecasts went from &amp;ldquo;maybe it will hit you&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;if you stay you&amp;rsquo;ll surely die&amp;rdquo;
to &amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s not going to hit you anymore&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Phew, it will miss&amp;rdquo; in four days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a lot of preparation using conditional probabilities. In our assessment,
it would be very unlikely for the hurricane to hit both the East and West coast
simultaneously. So we decided to move the family from Parkland, FL to Tampa
(back then, the hurricane was forecasted to hit the East coast), but to book hotels
in both Pensacola (Florida panhandle) and Jacksonville, FL while we waited for new
forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As days went by, the forecasts moved further and further West. On Saturday 2 AM, the
forecast was that the hurricane would hit Tampa as a Category 4, so staying there was
too risky. And then we had to decide between moving to the Florida panhandle, moving to Jacksonville
and incredibly, going back to Parkland, near Fort Lauderdale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty seemed higher for places that were north of Tampa: it was hard to tell
whether the hurricane would turn either way in 3 days. On the other hand, the forecasts are better
in close proximity to the hurricane, and it seemed pretty certain that the hurricane would miss
the Parkland/Boca Raton area. So we made the somewhat gutsy call that my wife would come back
to Parkland with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s surely an element of luck to all of this, but the outcome was positive. We had very
minor damage in our house: a couple plants and a downspout. I think the total amount of
damage is going to be less than $100. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be precise because there may be damage
that is hard to see, like on the roof. We did not lose power, internet or even satellite TV.
The hardest part was the stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning the winds were back to normal. There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of debris around the county.
I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to fly back home tomorrow, if the airport opens, and hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be
able to get a ride home. This was more of a suspense than a horror movie. Many people were
not as lucky as we were and we&amp;rsquo;ll now see how we can help them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My complicated relationship with the second amendment</title>
      <link>/post/my-complicated-relationship-with-the-second-amendment/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on 2018-02-26, after thinking a lot about guns after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Parkland School Shooting&lt;/a&gt;,
but I&amp;rsquo;m burying this article in the past because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of passion around this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Parkland, FL, and I have three kids. When the Parkland School Shooting happened, my kids were in elementary school, and out of danger. Many of our friends and
their kids were not so lucky as we were. I used to take for granted that my kids would come back from school every day, unharmed. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also a registered Republican, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a conservative by any means. My ideas align strongly with the Libertarian movement. Many libertarian ideas align with
the Republican party, but not all: for example, libertarians abhor the swelling of the military and police that happens during Republican terms.
On the other hands, libertarians are fierce defenders of individual rights, including the right to bear arms.
Although I lean strong libertarian, I don&amp;rsquo;t like guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a gun or that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t shoot someone that was a threat to my life or the life of a family member.
If the best option was using lethal force, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure I would use it. I just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like it.
On the other hand, I think society would be much simpler if guns were rare and less lethal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t like guns, as long as the Second Amendment is in the Constitution, I will support it. I would also support repealing it. A representative
that has a platform of repealing the Second Amendment has my attention and likely my vote. A representative that wants to &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; the Second Amendment, on the other hand,
doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably hard to understand. People are usually &amp;ldquo;pro-gun&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;anti-gun&amp;rdquo;, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. Anything that scores points for your team is good. But
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; are not just for one team. They are the rules of the game.
I don&amp;rsquo;t like restricting the Second Amendment in a similar way that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like having some type of penalty being called only against my team. Heck,
even if it was the other team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rights should be extremely hard to restrict. I think we lost that battle with the Fourth Amendment. Instead of going through the painful motions of
repealing a right, reaction to some event erodes the right little by little, until the right is a shell of what it was. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t like guns
and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind that erosion happening with the Second Amendment, I do. Because I care about our rights. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we would have such a great
country without the rights we do, and I also don&amp;rsquo;t think the country can continue to be great if rights can easily be restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think &amp;ldquo;but high-powered weapons are &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, and it may feel like that to many, including me. But if you start transferring that logic to
other rights, then it may not make as much sense. The government may get the power to ban high-powered weapons. It may get the power to ban high-powered
speech. It may get the power to ban jury trials on &amp;ldquo;high-powered crimes&amp;rdquo;. The poor Fourth Amendment is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.duicentral.com/dui/the-dui-exception/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;full of holes&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound like a &amp;lsquo;slippery slope&amp;rsquo; argument. It&amp;rsquo;s not. I&amp;rsquo;m not arguing that &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; we restrict one right we may get better at restrict others. I&amp;rsquo;m arguing that
the bar to restrict any right should be ludicrously high, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t like them. And it has not been consistently high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/marcorubio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt;, the future former Florida Senator, bless his heart, posted
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-a-new-way-to-tackle-gun-deaths.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
from the New York Times on Twitter. The article is full of good ideas, but idiotic: comparing driving with the Second Amendment is disingenuous.
The Second Amendment is a right, driving isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am for repealing the Second Amendment, but not restricting it.&lt;/p&gt;
