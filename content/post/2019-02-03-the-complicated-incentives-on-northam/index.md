In February 1st 2019, it was found that the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Whatever Northam, had a picture in his medical school yearbook that contained a person in black face and another person wearing a Klu-Klux-Klan hood. Many people of all party affiliations called for his immediate resignation. By February 3rd, 2019, Northam had not yet resigned. 

There was, of course, a lot of debate on social media. Should Northam stay? Should he go?

## The players

* **Northam himself:** it's hard to know his utility function, but with some assumptions we can construct a simple one. We could assume that  Northam is "untouchable" and that his career is essentially done, so he gets utility by staying in place as long as he can. We could instead assume that if he were to "fall on his sword" he would be rewarded by his party.

* **Democrats**: for the Democrats, the utility function is simple. Northam must go. If he stays, he will enrage the democratic party base. The party can replace him by another democrat that can, in theory, enact the same policies. Perhaps this replacement is not as competent as "Untainted Northam" (and this is why Northam was elected in the first place), but now Northam is tainted and can be presumed ineffective.

* **Society**: This is, presumably, the hardest one to construct an utility function for, as so much will depend on assumptions. The first assumption I'll make will be that Northam is a competent administrator. I'm also going to assume that a racist administrator would be considered incompetent by society. Although this may seem obvious, a racist society could prefer a racist administrator to a competent one, so embedded in the "competent administrator" assumption there's an assumption that the society is not racist. Another assumption is that racism is an immutable trait. This is the assumption I'm least comfortable with.

* **Other administrators**: these are people that could be candidates like Northam. The assumptions are that we have "competent administrators", "racist administrators" (that could pass as competent) and "incompetent administrators". We will assume that being in power is a desirable good, and that "racist administrators" can feign competency better than "incompetent administrators". We will also assume that a "racist administrator" is even worse than an "incompetent administrator" for society.

## How many models do we have here?
