My father passed away a few years ago. I don't even remember exactly when. I think it was in 2013 or 2014. We were not close when he died, and I don't remember we ever being close. To my memory, he was mostly away since I was around 7, and he left home when I was 13. Not having a father made a lot of things harder in my life, which I imagine made me more capable in some respects.

## My original case for a two-parent household

Well, it's not necessarily a case for a *father*, but more a case for a household with two parents, no matter their genders. When I was a teenager, the only opinion I had was my mom's, right or wrong. Not having another parent in the house made it more expensive for me to validate my mother's opinions. One example was when I wanted to leave a low-income, dead-end job for another job. My mom was of the opinion that "job longevity" and loyalty were very valuable traits - that one shouldn't leave a job after a short period of time. My questionings didn't go very far. In that case I ended up not folowing my mother's opinion and changed jobs. I'm sure the change had a positive impact in my career, but I was terrified.
