> I'm writing this on 2018-02-26, after thinking a lot about guns after the [Parkland School Shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting), 
> but I'm burying this article in the past because there's a lot of passion around this topic.

I live in Parkland, FL, and I have three kids. When the Parkland School Shooting happened, my kids were in elementary school, and out of danger. Many of our friends and 
their kids were not so lucky as we were. I used to take for granted that my kids would come back from school every day, unharmed. Now I don't.

I'm also a registered Republican, but I'm not a conservative by any means. My ideas align strongly with the Libertarian movement. Many libertarian ideas align with 
the Republican party, but not all: for example, libertarians abhor the swelling of the military and police that happens during Republican terms. 
On the other hands, libertarians are fierce defenders of individual rights, including the right to bear arms. 
Although I lean strong libertarian, I don't like guns. 

This does not mean that I wouldn't have a gun or that I wouldn't shoot someone that was a threat to my life or the life of a family member. 
If the best option was using lethal force, I'm fairly sure I would use it. I just wouldn't like it. 
On the other hand, I think society would be much simpler if guns were rare and less lethal.

Even though I don't like guns, as long as the Second Amendment is in the Constitution, I will support it. I would also support repealing it. A representative
that has a platform of repealing the Second Amendment has my attention and likely my vote. A representative that wants to *limit* the Second Amendment, on the other hand,
doesn't.

This is probably hard to understand. People are usually "pro-gun" or "anti-gun", and that's it. Anything that scores points for your team is good. But 
the [Bill of Rights](http://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/) are not just for one team. They are the rules of the game.
I don't like restricting the Second Amendment in a similar way that I wouldn't like having some type of penalty being called only against my team. Heck, 
even if it was the other team.

Rights should be extremely hard to restrict. I think we lost that battle with the Fourth Amendment. Instead of going through the painful motions of 
repealing a right, reaction to some event erodes the right little by little, until the right is a shell of what it was. Although I don't like guns
and shouldn't mind that erosion happening with the Second Amendment, I do. Because I care about our rights. I don't think we would have such a great
country without the rights we do, and I also don't think the country can continue to be great if rights can easily be restricted. 

You may think "but high-powered weapons are *evil*", and it may feel like that to many, including me. But if you start transferring that logic to 
other rights, then it may not make as much sense. The government may get the power to ban high-powered weapons. It may get the power to ban high-powered
speech. It may get the power to ban jury trials on "high-powered crimes". The poor Fourth Amendment is 
[full of holes](https://www.duicentral.com/dui/the-dui-exception/) already.

This may sound like a 'slippery slope' argument. It's not. I'm not arguing that _because_ we restrict one right we may get better at restrict others. I'm arguing that
the bar to restrict any right should be ludicrously high, even if I don't like them. And it has not been consistently high. 

[Marco Rubio](https://twitter.com/marcorubio), the future former Florida Senator, bless his heart, posted 
[this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-a-new-way-to-tackle-gun-deaths.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share) 
from the New York Times on Twitter. The article is full of good ideas, but idiotic: comparing driving with the Second Amendment is disingenuous. 
The Second Amendment is a right, driving isn't.

I am for repealing the Second Amendment, but not restricting it.
